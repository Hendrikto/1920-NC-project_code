## Environment

We use Pipenv to manage our dependencies inside of a virtual environment. `Pipfile.lock` contains the exact versions and hashes of the dependencies which we used. To reproduce this environment, follow these steps:

* install Pipenv: `pip install --user pipenv`
* install depencies: `pipenv sync`
* enable virtual environment: `pipenv shell`
